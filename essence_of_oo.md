## 1. What is code rot, and why does it happen?
    - Code rot is the gradual decline in the quality of your code over time.
    - Code rot is caused by new dependencies and fetures over time, and as they gt added the code becomes harder to understand, more prone to bugs, and inefficient

## 2. What is the design of a software product?
    -   The design of a software product is the blueprint of how the software is built and how its components interact with each other.

## 3. According to Uncle Bob, what is the essential characteristic of Object-Oriented design?
    - The essential characteristic of OO is the ability to invert key depenndencies. (Dependency Inversion)
    - This means that high level modules should not rely on low level modules. 
    - The modules should rely on abstractions
    - This is helps prevent code rot as when low level modules change, it does not affect high level modules.
